# Package In Java

Packages in Java are a mechanism to encapsulate a group of classes, interfaces, and sub-packages. In Java, it is used for making search/locating and usage of classes, interface, enumerations, and annotations easier. It can be considered as data encapsulation also. In other words, we can say a package is a container of a group of related classes where some of the classes are accessible are exposed, and others are kept for internal purposes.

## Types of Packages in Java
1. User Defined Packages
2. Builtin Packages


### 1. User-defined Packages

User-defined packages are those packages that are designed or created by the developer to categorize classes and packages. They are much similar to the built-in that java offers. It can be imported into other classes and used the same as we use built-in packages. But If we omit the package statement, the class names are put into the default package, which has no name.

As the name propose, user-defined packages in Java are essentially packages that are defined by the programmer. Whenever we want to add a class to the package, we have to mention the package name and the “package” keyword at the top of the program.

### 2. Builtin Packages

The already defined package like java.io.*, java. lang.* etc., are known as built-in packages.

The Packages contains components for managing input, database programming, and much much more. The complete list can be found at Oracles website [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/).
