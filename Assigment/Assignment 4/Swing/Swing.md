# Java Swing

Java Swing  is a part of Java Foundation Classes (JFC) that is used to create window-based applications. It is built on the top of AWT(Abstract Windowing Toolkit) API and entirely written in java.

Unlike AWT, Java Swing provides platform-independent and lightweight components.

The javax.swing package provides classes for java swing API such as JButton, JTextField, JTextArea, JRadioButton, JCheckbox, JMenu, JColorChooser etc.
